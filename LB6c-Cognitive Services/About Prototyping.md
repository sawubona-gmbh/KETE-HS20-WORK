# UI/UX Prototyping 

## Difference between Wireframe, Mockup and Prototype
A **Wireframe** is a skeletal framework of a website or app which has 3 simple goals; present the main page contents, outline the page structure and layout and display basic website/app UIs. So, **it is perfect to be used at the brainstorming or very early design stage.**

A **Mockup** is a static wireframe with much more UI and visual details. It gives viewers a more realistic impression of how the final website/app will look like, So, **it is good for communicating, discussing, collaborating and iterating projects with your team members at a later design stage.**

To some extent, a **Prototype** is a fully interactive, functional mockup with high-fidelity UIs, rich interactions and animations. It behaves and acts just like the final website/app product, So, **it is ideal to be used to test for potential app problems before moving into the development stage.**
