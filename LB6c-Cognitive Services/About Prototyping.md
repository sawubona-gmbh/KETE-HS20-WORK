## Difference between Wireframe, Mockup and Prototype
A **Wireframe** is a skeletal framework of a website or app which has 3 simple goals; present the main page contents, outline the page structure and layout and display basic website/app UIs. So, **it is perfect to be used at the brainstorming or very early design stage.**

A **Mockup** is a static wireframe with much more UI and visual details. It gives viewers a more realistic impression of how the final website/app will look like, So, **it is good for communicating, discussing, collaborating and iterating projects with your team members at a later design stage.**

To some extent, a **Prototype** is a fully interactive, functional mockup with high-fidelity UIs, rich interactions and animations. It behaves and acts just like the final website/app product, So, **it is ideal to be used to test for potential app problems before moving into the development stage.**

## UX Prototyping Tools and how to pick the right one 
The Right Tool is the one that makes the job for you. In this [video](https://youtu.be/J4XuVHffOUI), you will walk through a handful of criteria/principles that allow you to pick the right UX tool for the right project, budget, occasion etc. <img width="1267" alt="prototyping tools" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44829900/98557629-bca76500-22a4-11eb-8fc1-0ad78bd1f1ce.png">

## Axure RP
Axure RP is one of the powerful UX/UI prototyping tools on the market. In this section, you will be introduced to simple tasks which you can do using Axure RP. If you want to go deeper, there are a lot of Textbooks and online video tutorials which can help you. My recommendations are:
- [vaexperience](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMEQZDhP_k_YkFnwoCgT7SQ) youtube channel, [Getting started with Axure Prototyping | Axure RP: Noob to Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzV2d2KxzWI&list=PLM2Dd2NIn2CrF2V-xQyZ_Nk3vQNUl2UCG)
- [Axure RP Reference](https://docs.axure.com/axure-rp/reference/getting-started-video/)
- **Axure RP Prototyping Cookbook** *by John Henry Krahenbuhl.* This guide provides fast, practical, step-by-step recipes to create your own custom prototypes for mobile and desktop. 

Here are some of Axure RP features, which you may use in your project. Enjoy :)
#### Working with Variables
[Create a Smart Login with Variables](https://youtu.be/kOLbbgCCY7k)
> In this session I'll walk you through how to use variables in order to pass login username from login page to a landing homepage and display it back to the end-user. You can use the same logic to pass absolutely any information from one page to the next.
#### Working with Functions
[Creating a Shopping Cart Experience](https://youtu.be/Wg-omH7EFAU)
> In this session I'll walk you through key steps to making a functional shopping cart. The end result will allow users to add and remove products, calculate subtotal and even VAT tax. We will use Axure math functions, variables and ingenious ways to solve small problems.
#### Working with Condition Statements
[Form Field Validation with Condition Statements](https://youtu.be/IjOovDR3CrE)
> In this session I'll walk you through how to add form validation logic and conditions to your input fields.
#### How to Export and Save User Input Data
[How to Export and Save User Input Data](https://youtu.be/YuZfrajUhvc)
> In this session I'll walk you through one of the only ways to export/save data from Axure prototypes. This is one of the walk-arounds that don't require 3rd party plugins or additional development. I'll show you how you can trigger a specific markup line that will capture all input values and send an email (mailto method) to your inbox. It's not ideal, but it's very quick and easy way to assure that whatever users input in your UX prototypes will be saved.
#### Using Repeaters to Present and Interact with Data
